>&quot;I find hope in the darkest of days, and focus in the brightest. I do not judge the universe.&quot;

HMFAYSAL OMEGA is a minimalist, beautiful, responsive theme for Jekyll designed for engineers as well as writers who want their content to take front and center. This theme elegantly wraps each page and post with featured images complementing the content. It was built -- by Engineer slash Mathematician [Hossain Mohd Faysal](http://alum.mit.edu/www/hmfaysal/).

**Hossain Mohd. Faysal** is an MSc + PhD candidate in *Electrical Engineering* at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/) at **University of Pennsylvania**. He is licensed as a Professional Engineer (P.E) to practice in the states of Texas, Massachusetts and California. Faysal graduated with a double-major in EECS and Mathematics during his undergraduate life, and currently focusing on Solid State Electronics for his post-graduate studies.

At some point in the not-terribly-distant future, Faysal hopes to found a self-sustaining collective of clever people, for fun, profit(?), and the promotion of human life in the universe. This might wind up in Qatar, Bangladesh, Scandinavia, the Massachusetts Bay Area, the SF Bay Area, Japan, Germany, or the dustbin of overly idealistic plans. (Yes, Faysal has a special bin for overly idealistic plans. In my district they can't be recycled with residential mixed paper.) The most challenging aspect of this concept is to curtail unproductive competition with other people who will inevitably have the same idea. (Some sort of cooperative federation...) He is presently looking for people who might be interested in being a part of such an organization.

Anyways, for now Faysal is just working toward changing the face of Electrical Engineering forever. Not that he necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.

This website was built with Jekyll and features the HMFAYSAL OMEGA Theme, the coolest theme for Jekyll.
